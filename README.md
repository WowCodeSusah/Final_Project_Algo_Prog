# Brief Desciption
For my final project I made an unnamed game based on the popular game mario. Is a two dimensional platformer that is made in pygame with a few different added modules to aid in importing files. The game was first named RePixel but I ended up scrapping the idea due to pixel art is hard and I couldn't find suitable resources as replacements so with the pixel art I found on google it ended up more like tomb raider then what I imagined my game looking as, hence the reason its unnamed at the moment. The game is able to run with a standard start menu and only 1 single level that being level 1. The game features no enemies and the only way to die is to fall off the map, which resets your position back to the start menu. The game is more of a pixel art parkour then a 2d platformer but it does take likeness from mario games. The player character has an idle animation being pulling out her gun and putting in back and jumping, running, and also falling animations. There are also dust particles that spawn underneath the player as they fall, jump, or run.
